# verves
A software to scrape and index forum threads.

This is a Python script that scrapes web forums.

It reads the URLs for top-level forum indices from sites.txt, and gets all the subforums from that page.
Then it goes through the subforums to make a list of threads.
After being scraped, the list of threads can be sorted by most recent posts, and put on a webpage.
